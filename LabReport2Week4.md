# Lab Report 2

## Context

During labs 3 & 4, my group and I worked on debugging a markdownParse file through creating failure-inducing tests and fixing the program to produce the correct outcome for those tests.  The following report will contain 3 sets of changes, the input that invoked those changes, the "symptom" that resulted from that input, and a short analysis.

## First Commit

the first commit was an implementation of breaks in the getLinks method that would trigger if the next character in the sequence was not in the file
